                <p>
                    I'm a student who never quit working toward a better understanding of computer science. After a poor grade in my Technology
                    class in middle school, I decided my computer skills needed sharpening, and 7 years later, I've gained experience working on both programming and electronics. 
                    Practice makes perfect, and I know for certain I never would be where I am if not for my desire to strengthen my weaknesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My high school nurtured my interests in technology, providing me with the basic tools I would need to be prepared for college, and a career. 
                    But Computer Science wasn't my end-all; it was only the beginning for me. Cybersecurity would become my path, and my first experience in this 
                    field was through the <a href="https://girlsgocyberstart.org/">Girls Go Cyberstart</a> competition, where I first competed in a CTF, and
                    realized solving challenges and puzzles to protect a system or application was what I wanted to do. Cybersecurity became my career path, and now, 
                    I am determined to become a Penetration-tester and serve the public by defending against malicious actors.

                        I took Digital Electronics and 3 Computer Science classes to build my fundamental knowledge of computer science,
                        and participated in my own school's Code Girls club to learn more about web development. As a Code Girls member, I became part of my school's 
                        CyberStart team and competed in a CTF for the first time.

                        Since I discovered the the <a href="https://cybr.club/">TAMU Cybersecurity Club</a> my freshman year, I have decided my 
                        field will become Cybersecurity. I am finding more ways to practice my skillset and am determined to change the world for the better,
                        one patch at a time. For now, I'll be satisfied finding ways to learn more about networks and penetration-testing.

                    <li>
                        After graduation, as part of the CyberCorps, I will work in a federal posisiton to uphold the Cybersecurity mission of our nation.
                        Whatever position I take, I will dedicate myself to protecting the systems, applications, and data of our nation, and our people.
                        And when my service requirement is fulfilled, I will move to the private sector and continue defending the people's data to the best of my ability.
