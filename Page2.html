            <p>
                High school gave me my first experience with Computer Science principles, and while taking courses, I developed a
                <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/comp-sci-rules?usp=sharing">Computer Science Principles Portfolio</a> where
                I stored my project documentation and gave small demonstrations of programs in action using different block-based 
                programming environments, such as <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, <a href="https://www.alice.org/">Alice</a>, and 
                <a href="https://www.greenfoot.org/download">Greenfoot</a>.

                    <h3>Freshman Year</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Many of my latest projects have been a result of programming in college. 
                            In my Freshman year, me and my team constructed a <a href="https://github.com/Starsky3/MiniArcade">Mini Arcade</a>,
                            which gives a player the choice of picking between 3 games located in the main menu:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Choose your own adventure,</li>
                                <li>12th Man Wordsearch, or</li>
                                <li>Disney Trivia</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Sophomore Year</h3>   
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            During my Sophomore year, I created projects dealing with concepts ranging from Dynamic Memory allocation to Linked Lists.
                            As a personal side project, I built a <a href="https://github.com/Starsky3/BinaryConverter">Binary Converter</a>
                            to convert input given by the user into a binary string which would be given as output. 
                            It was mostly an experiment with iostream and sstream, giving me practice with converting between strings and integer values.
                        </li>
                    </ul> 
                    <h3>Junior Year</h3>       
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This website itself is actually itself a project. You can look at the html, css, and javascript source code in my repository on <a href="https://github.com/csce-315-331-2023c/project-1-estradaagg13">github</a>.
                        </li>
