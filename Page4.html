            <p>Every step along my college journey, I've been supported and encouraged not only by my Professors, but by
                my peers, tutors and mentors. Now, I'm working to do my part paying forward all the wisdom, guidance, and knowledge I've been given through my volunteer work.

            <h2>WiCyS Club Officer</h2>
            <p>
                Part of my freshman experience was finding a group where I belonged. While I discovered Cybersecurity through the TAMU Cyber club,
                the TAMU Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS) club was where I found my friends. 
                Becoming part of a close-knit community who I know has my back and will support me has been invaluable during my college experience. Just last year, I attended
                the Annual WiCyS Conference held in Denver, Colorado, where I learned the value of networking and the importance of diversity in thought.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, as a General Officer in TAMU WiCyS, it's my pleasure to help educate the new members on cybersecurity, encryption, and the importance of their own network for
                their career goals, and for their work-life balance.

                As part of the <a href="https://sfs.opm.gov/">Scholarschip for Service</a>, I've become part of the CyberCorps. After I graduate, I will be 
                working in a federal position for a year for each semester covered by the scholarship. And in doing so, I will be providing a public service to my community 
                and to my fellow countrymen.
